- So, this is the result history page where there are 2 buttons.It is ordered by recent data. **Filter button** can be used to filter the table by date entered on **Filter by date input datepicker**. And the table can be reset by clicking on the **Reset Table button**.

- Using Cryptography encryption for the ids to make it encrypted on the UI so that the system will not be vulnerable against SQL injection.
- Pagination functionality on Search History table so that it does not affect performance issues
- Sorting functionalities on the table
- More test cases and integration tests
- Add logs to the system
